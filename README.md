# AES Encryption Project

## Overview

This project implements the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm using Assembly Language. The program takes a 128-bit key and a 128-bit input string, encrypts the input using the AES algorithm, and outputs the encrypted result.

## Features

- **AES Encryption**: Implements the core AES encryption algorithm.
- **Key Schedule**: Generates round keys from the provided key.
- **Substitution, Shifting, and Mixing**: Performs the required transformations on the data.
- **User Input**: Prompts the user for a key and plaintext input.

## Requirements

- An assembler that supports Assembly Language (emulator).
